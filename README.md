# Surfs-Up

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to retrieve and analyze weather data for Hawaii using SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask. Our client wants to open a surf and ice cream shop and has asked us to analyze the weather in Oahu so he can choose the best location.

## Results

- June temperatures have a spread of about 21 degrees Fahrenheit, with a minimum of 64 degrees and a maximum of 85 degrees.
- December temperatures have a larger spread of about 27 degrees Fahrenheit, with a minimum of 56 degrees and a maximum of 83 degrees.
- The mean temperature for June is 74.94 degrees Fahrenheit, with a standard deviation of 3.26. The mean temperature for December is 71.04 degrees Fahrenheit, with a standard deviation of 3.75. 

## Summary

The results show that temperature is fairly consistent year-round in Oahu. The mean temperatures of June and December are remarkably close, with only an approximate 4 degree difference. Additional queries that we might perform to gather more weather data for June and December include summary statistics for precipitation levels for each month.
